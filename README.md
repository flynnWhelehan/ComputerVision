# ComputerVision
Some practice in computer vision. Potential for a final year project idea.
### Small ideas for meantime
- When is the best time to find a space outside my flat
  - How long to cars stay parked.
  - How close do they park to the car in front
    - (Is it a good place for new drivers who can't park well, or if you have a ferrari)
    - Can we identify types of cars??
